No clear signs of pleural effusion were found on both sides of the chest, and the pleura on both sides was slightly thick."

      "finding": "Thorax is symmetrical, no abnormality is found in rib and chest wall soft tissue. The lung window shows an increase in bilateral lung markings, an increase in the transparency of both lungs, a plug like bright area in both lungs, and multiple nodules in the lungs. The largest nodule is located in the anterior basal segment of the lower lobe of the right lung (SE5, IM235). Some solid nodules are 34mmx30mm in size. Signs of lobulation, burrs, pleural depression, inflatable bronchi, and spinous processes can be seen. Bilateral pulmonary hili are not large. The shape of heart shadow and large vessels is normal, and no mass or enlarged lymph node is found in mediastinum. No pleural effusion, bilateral pleural hypertrophy."
